# Sudoku-Game
Welcome to my Suduoku Game! I created a version of Sudoku using Python and Pygame modules. The game uses a backtracking algorithm to solve a Sudoku board.

Run the Sudoku-GUI.py to play (requires Pygame modules).

# Instructions 
The basic controls are as follows:

Mouse click - select number or box

Number keys - input number (1-9)

Enter - checks all user answers and scores

Spacebar - deletes selected number

Correct input will be displayed with a green box surrounding the number. Black numbers are original board values given at the start of the game
