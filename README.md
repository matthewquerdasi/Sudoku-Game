# Sudoku-Game
Welcome to my Suduoku Game! I created a version of Sudoku using Python and Pygame modules. The game uses a backtracking algorithm to solve a Sudoku board.

# Instructions 
The game has a timer and mistakes counter to keep track of how many incorrect numbers are input by the user. The basic controls are as follows:

Mouse click - select number or box

Number keys - input number (1-9)

Enter - checks all user answers 

Spacebar - deletes selected 

Correct input will be displayed with a green box surrounding the number. Black numbers are original board values given at the start of the game
